## How can I use it?

## How can I build/deploy it?

## How was it developed? (How does it work?)

Here is how it was made:

### Brainstorming

It was a completely random idea. A project was needed and since Jozsef and Daniel did not have any specific ideas, they just picked a topic which they thought they could learn the most from. Hence the choice was a note app, which is somewhat similar to Google Keep, but simpler and more minimalistic.

The idea was that users can save notes after logging in. They can of course edit them. When that's done, then they wanted users to be able to make the notes public, so everybody can see them. After all that is done and there is still time left, then they wanted to enable users to share notes between eachother.

### Wireframe

Sorry, the initial wireframes were made in Hungarian, but hopefully you get the idea. This was just a quick example how the app might look like.

### Git(Hub)

Git was used for collaboration. Jozsef and Daniel both did the coding on their own computers and used Git for working together and for version control. The code was uploaded to GitHub regularly, after changes were made to the source.

### Frontend

- Daniel carried out this part. Js. Angular. Rxjs. Requestek. Material design.

### Database

- Jozsef worked mostly on this part, but got help from Daniel.

### Backend

- Daniel worked mostly on this part, but got help from Jozsef. NodeJS. Express. Cors. Json.

### Desktop

- Jozsef carried out this part.

## Which are the future plans?

World domination of course, khm... on a more serious note:

- GitHub, Google, Facebook login possibility
- Email intergration for registration and forgotten passwords
- In-app chat functionality
- Plaintext note downloading as .txt files

## Why was it needed?

Jozsef and Daniel started an adult course and to be able to fulfill all the requirements of the course, they needed to deliver a responsive fullstack app with an optional desktop app, hence this app was born.

## Where was it created?

- Made with <3 in Budapest, Hungary.

## When was is developed?

- Between January and May of 2022.
